# Deploy the self-contained connector binary to the OT-2.
# Does not require pip, a venv, or any Python on the robot.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy_executable.sh <hostname> [connector_dir]
#
# Arguments:
#   hostname       Robot hostname or IP
#   connector_dir  Local directory containing the connector binary and config
#                  (default: dist_connector). Must contain:
#                    - connector  (the PyInstaller binary)
#                    - ot2_config.json
#
# Normally called by scripts/setup_ot2.sh, which downloads this directory from
# the latest "ot2-latest" GitHub Release first.
